* Scripts explanation
run_test.sh compiles the tests in the benchmarks folder, can customize which test to auto run
setup.sh compiles and runs the disk_setup.c code script to test writing to the disk file
r_ fuse.sh compiles the tfs.c and mounts the file system. you can navigate to /tmp/hs884/mountdir and test out functions


* Time to complete
the following are the times of the benchmarks in microseconds
| test         | time |
|--------------+------|
| simple test  | 2905 |
| test case    | 7025 |
| bitmap check | 2430 |
